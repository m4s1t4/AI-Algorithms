# Data Science and Machine Learning with Python

Welcome to the Data Science and Machine Learning with Python repository! This collection showcases various AI algorithms that I have been coding as part of my practice and personal projects. Explore how to harness the power of Python and popular libraries for data science and machine learning tasks.

## Overview

This repository contains the following Python scripts, demonstrating different machine learning concepts and techniques:

- **naiveBayes.py**: Implements a Naive Bayes classifier for predicting movie ratings using real-world user rating data.

- **nnPytorch.py**: Demonstrates building and training a neural network using PyTorch to predict California housing prices.

- **nnScikit.py**: Utilizes Scikit-learn's MLPRegressor for creating a neural network to perform regression on housing data.

- **nnScratch.py**: Develops a simple neural network with a single hidden layer from scratch, showcasing the underlying mechanics without external deep learning frameworks.

- **nnTensorflow.py**: Constructs and trains a neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to predict housing prices, highlighting how to leverage high-level abstractions for efficient model building.

- **preventingOverfitting.py**: Explores techniques to mitigate overfitting in neural networks using dropout and early stopping strategies in PyTorch.

## Dependencies

To run these scripts, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `tensorflow`
- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `torchaudio`
- `imblearn`

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow torch torchvision torchaudio imbalanced-learn
```

## Key Learnings

- **Naive Bayes**: Understand probabilistic classifiers and evaluate classification performance using metrics like confusion matrices, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

- **Deep Learning with PyTorch and TensorFlow**: Learn how to create and optimize neural networks leveraging PyTorch and TensorFlow's powerful capabilities.

- **Model from Scratch**: Gain experience in constructing neural networks using basic numpy operations, focusing on the low-level aspects of model building.

- **Regularization Techniques**: Discover methods to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization with techniques such as dropout and early stopping.

## Usage

Each script can be executed independently. To run a script, use:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the specific script file you wish to execute.
